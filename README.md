This is my first real webpage and my first GitHub repository, please be gentle!

I'm using Nginx to serve a simple React app from a VPS on Digital Ocean, not much to see.

Try clicking anywhere on the page and typing the name of the artist (gewzer) 4 a surprise.

This page is a portfolio for my friend Juan aka gewzer and a learning project for me.
